*** Protocol to obtain membrane profiles ***

For the followig guidelines to work, you must have the ELBA-LAMMPS
tools available in your working directory. You can simply copy all the 
tools in the working directory, or you can add elba-lammps/tools to 
your path (recommended).

- Run the 'bilayer_128dopc4232wat' example. This will generate various
  	'.zProfile' files which can be postprocessed as described in the
	following steps. 
- Run edp.sh tool to obtain electron density profiles (edp*.dat). You
	can then visualize the curves with, e.g., Grace: xmgrace edp*
- Run epp.sh tool to obtain electron potential profiles (epp*.dat). Ditto
	re visualization. 
- Run stress2press.py tool to obtain lateral pressure profile (lpp.dat).
	As explained in the comments at the top of 'stress2press.py', 
	you need to supply an input file (in this case 'stress.zProfile')
	and a value for the interfacial area (typically this can be 
	obtained as lipidArea * numberOfLipidsPerLeaflet)
