The ELBA-LAMMPS toolkit is a collection of tools aimed at facilitating the
simulation of the ELBA model in LAMMPS. The toolkit can be considered as an 
add-on package that offers users various functionalities to setup, run and
analyze LAMMPS simulations of ELBA molecular models.

The ELBA force field is described in Orsi & Essex, PLoS ONE 6: e28637 (2011).

The various folders in the ELBA-LAMMPS toolkit contain usage information 
in the form of README files. 

- install: probably the place to start, this directory contains 
	instructions on how to build LAMMPS with all (and only) the 
	features necessary to simulate the ELBA model

- examples: various test runs, which can be used to check the LAMMPS build 
	and as starting points for new simulations 

- tools: scripts performing various operations, such as analysis of LAMMPS 
	output files to extract properties of interest and file manipulation
	to enable trajectory visualization; check comments at the top of 
	each file to find usage information 

- viz: status files for visualization of ELBA systems with VMD
