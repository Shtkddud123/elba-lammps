This is the ELBA-LAMMPS toolkit, a collection of tools to assist in the 
simulation of the ELBA model in LAMMPS. The various folders should contain 
usage information in the form of README files. 

- install: probably the place to start, this directory contains 
	instructions on how to build LAMMPS with all (and only) the 
	features necessary to simulate the ELBA model

- examples: various test runs, which can be used to check the build, and
	as starting points for new simulations 

- bench: benchmark simulations, useful to check performances on large 
	number of processors

- tools: scripts performing various operations - check info at the top of
	each file to

- viz: VMD status files for optimal visualization of ELBA systems
