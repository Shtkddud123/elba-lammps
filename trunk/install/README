*** Installing LAMMPS ***

Detailed information on how to build LAMMPS can be found on the official
website (http://lammps.sandia.gov). Before building LAMMPS for ELBA, please
read the official LAMMPS compilation instructions. 

The following guidelines are guaranteed to work with the 25Sep11 version 
of LAMMPS, whereas they may or may not work with other versions. 
I will try to maintain compatibility with the latest version; if you are
having problems with compiling any version more recent than 25Sep11, let me
know (orsimario@gmail.com). No support will be provided for versions older
than 25Sep11 (sorry).  

i) Pre-compilation

The following protocol assembles the ELBA-required source code and discards 
many non-necessary components:

- Download and extract LAMMPS tarball from official website
- cd lammps-25Sep11/src/
- make no-all 
- make yes-dipole yes-molecule 
- cp USER-MISC/pair_dipole_sf.* .
- cp elba-lammps/lmp/src/angle_dipole.* .

ii) Compilation

Compiling LAMMPS can be non-trivial, as compilation protocols tend to be 
specific to each different system. So you must have a "Makefile" which is
suitable for your machine. The Makefiles provided in this directory, or those 
shipped with the official LAMMPS distribution, should be useful starting 
points.
 
As examples, these are compilation protocols that work for me on computers 
running GNU/Linux operating systems:
 
*) HPC example: compiling LAMMPS on the Iridis HPC machine (U Southampton):
- cp elba-lammps/install/Makefile.iridis-icc-fast lammps-25Sep11/src/MAKE
- cd lammps-25Sep11/src
- module load openmpi
- make iridis-icc-fast

*) Desktop example: compiling LAMMPS on my UOS desktop
- cp elba-lammps/install/Makefile.uos-icc lammps-25Sep11/src/MAKE 
- cd lammps-25Sep11/src
- module load icc openmpi
- make uos-icc
