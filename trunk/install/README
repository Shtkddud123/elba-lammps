*** Installing LAMMPS ***
Detailed information on how to build LAMMPS can be found on the official
website (http://lammps.sandia.gov). 
Specific packages that need to be included because required by the ELBA model:
- DIPOLE
- MOLECULE
- USER-MISC
In general, LAMMPS installation procedures are specific to users's local 
machine(s). As examples, the next sections give protocols that work for me.
These should be good starting points, but some tweaks are likely to be needed.

i) Pre-compilation
- Download and extract LAMMPS tarball from official website
- cd lammps-xx/src/
- make no-all
- make yes-dipole yes-molecule 
- cp USER-MISC/pair_dipole_sf.* .
- cp USER-MISC/bond_dipole.* .

ii) Compilation
- Prepare a "Makefile" suitable for your machine. It's probably best to start
from the makefiles provided in this directory, or those shipped with the 
official LAMMPS distribution. 
 
*) Example: Compiling LAMMPS on the Iridis HPC machine (U Southampton):
- cp elba-lammps/install/Makefile.iridis lammps-xx/src/MAKE
- cd lammps-xx/src
- module load openmpi
- make iridis

** Compiling LAMMPS on UOS machines **
This is how I install LAMMPS on my University of Southampton GNU/LINUX desktop.
- Edit "src/MAKE/Makefile.linux":
	MPI_INC =  -I/local/software/openmpi/1.2.4/pgi-7.1/include
	MPI_PATH =  	-L/local/software/openmpi/1.2.4/pgi-7.1/lib
	MPI_LIB =	-lmpi -lpthread
- module load openmpi
- make linux
