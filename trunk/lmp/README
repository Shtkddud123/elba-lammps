This is a repository of my contributions to LAMMPS. It is for my personal use,
but feel free to have a look if you like.
Most of the files in this folder should be shipped with the official LAMMPS 
distribution. Those that are not, are experimental pieces of code, drafts of
future functionalities, etc.  
The rest of the elba-lammps toolkit should not require any of the material
included here.
