This is a repository of LAMMPS source code and documentation specifically
developed for the ELBA model. This folder is mainly for my personal use,
although some aspects of the elba-lammps toolkit might refer to material
stored here.

Some of the files in this folder are shipped with the official LAMMPS 
distribution. Other files might be required when building LAMMPS for ELBA -
the instructions in install/README should clarify if this is the case.
