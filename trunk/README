This is the ELBA-LAMMPS toolkit, a collection of tools to assist in the 
simulation of the ELBA model in LAMMPS. The various folders should contain 
usage information in the form of README files. 

The place to start is probably the 'install' directory, which contains
instructions on how to build LAMMPS with the necessary features to simulate
the ELBA model.
