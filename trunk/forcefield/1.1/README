This directory contains the 1.1 version of the ELBA force field. 
This is the most recent version, which all users are strongly advised to
adopt.

The elba-1.1 force field is presented in this paper:
- Orsi M, Essex JW (2013) Physical properties of mixed bilayers containing 
lamellar and nonlamellar lipids: insights from coarse-grain molecular 
dynamics simulations, Faraday Discussions 161: 249. 
See the supporting information of the paper for an easy-to-read table 
collecting the elba-1.1 parameters.
