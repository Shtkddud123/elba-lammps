This directory contains all versions of the ELBA force field. The general
features of the ELBA model are described in this paper:

- Orsi M, Essex JW (2011) The ELBA force field for coarse-grain modeling of 
lipid membranes, PloS ONE 6(12): e28637. 

In general, the ELBA force field is being constantly updated, extended 
and improved, so using the most recent version is recommended. 

The most recent version is elba-1.1, which is presented in this paper:

- Orsi M, Essex JW (2013) Physical properties of mixed bilayers containing 
lamellar and nonlamellar lipids: insights from coarse-grain molecular 
dynamics simulations, Faraday Discussions 161: 249.
