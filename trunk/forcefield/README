This directory contains all versions of the ELBA force field. The general
features of the ELBA model are described in this paper:

Orsi M, Essex JW (2011) The ELBA force field for coarse-grain modeling of 
lipid membranes, PloS ONE 6(12): e28637. DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0028637

The ELBA force field is being constantly updated, extended and improved,
so using the most recent version is recommended.
