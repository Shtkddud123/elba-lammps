This is a repository of the LAMMPS source code and documentation that
has been specifically developed for the ELBA model. 

Some of the files in this folder are shipped with the official LAMMPS 
distribution. Other files might be required when building LAMMPS for ELBA -
the instructions in install/README should clarify if this is the case.

In general, most of the material archived here is not relevant for most 
users, but it can be useful to current and perspective ELBA-LAMMPS 
authors.
