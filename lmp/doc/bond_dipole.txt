bond_style dipole command :h3

[Syntax:]

bond_style dipole :pre

[Examples:]

bond_style dipole
bond_coeff 6 2.1 180.0 :pre

[Description:]

The {dipole} bond style is used to control the orientation of a dipolar
atom 'j' with respect to a reference (bond) vector r_ij = r_i - r_j 
connecting 'j' with another atom 'i' within the same molecule. 

It is convenient to define an angle gamma such that:
:c,image(Eqs/bond_dipole_gamma.jpg)

The {dipole} bond style uses the potential

:c,image(Eqs/bond_dipole_potential.jpg)

where K is a rigidity constant and gamma0 is an equilibrium (reference)
angle. 

The torque on the dipole can be obtained by differentiating the bond 
dipole potential using the 'chain rule' as in appendix C.3 of 
"(Allen)"_#Allen):

:c,image(Eqs/bond_dipole_torque.jpg)

In practice, this torque restrains the orientation of the dipolar atom.
For example, if gamma0 is set to 0 degrees, the torque generated by
the bond dipole potential will tend to align the dipole along the 
reference direction defined by the (bond) vector r_ij.

Note that the bond dipole potential does not give rise to any force, 
because it does not depend on the distance between i and j (it only 
depends on the angle between mu_j and r_ij).

The following coefficients must be defined for each bond type via the
"bond_coeff"_bond_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

K (energy)
gamma0 (degrees) :ul

[Restrictions:]

This bond style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
"user-misc" package.  See the "Making LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_3 
section for more info on packages.

In the "Bonds" section of the data file, the atom id 'j'
corresponding to the dipole to restrain must come before the atom id 
of the reference atom 'i'.

The "newton" command for intramolecular interactions must be "on" 
(which it is by default).

This bond style should not be used with SHAKE.

This bond style should not be used with 'compute bond/local'.
