</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>dipole</I> angle style is used to control the orientation of a point 
dipole mu_j (located at the mass center of atom 'j') with respect to a 
reference (bond) vector r_ij = r_i - r_j connecting 'j' with another 
atom 'i' within the same molecule. 
</P>
<P>It is convenient to define an angle gamma such that:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/angle_dipole_gamma.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>The <I>dipole</I> angle style uses the potential
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/angle_dipole_potential.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>where K is a rigidity constant and gamma0 is an equilibrium (reference)
angle. 
</P>
<P>The torque on the dipole can be obtained by differentiating the angle 
dipole potential using the 'chain rule' as in appendix C.3 of 
<A HREF = "#Allen">(Allen)</A>):
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/angle_dipole_torque.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>In practice, this torque restrains the orientation of the dipolar atom.
For example, if gamma0 is set to 0 degrees, the torque generated by
the potential will tend to align the dipole along the reference 
direction defined by the (bond) vector r_ij.
</P>
<P>Note that the angle dipole potential does not give rise to any force, 
because it does not depend on the distance between i and j (it only 
depends on the angle between mu_j and r_ij).
</P>
<P>The following coefficients must be defined for each angle type via the
<A HREF = "angle_coeff.html">angle_coeff</A> command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A>
or <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> commands:
</P>
<UL><LI>K (energy)
<LI>gamma0 (degrees) 
</UL>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This angle style can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the
"user-misc" package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_3">Making LAMMPS</A> 
section for more info on packages.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT: In the "Angles" section of the data file, the atom id 'j'
corresponding to the dipole to restrain must come before the atom id 
of the reference atom 'i'. A third atom id 'k' must also be provided,
although 'k' is just a 'dummy' atom which can be any atom; it may be 
useful to choose a convention (e.g., 'k'='i') and adhere to it. 
For example, if id=1 for the dipolar atom to restrain, and id=2 for 
the reference atom, the corresponding line in the "Angles" section 
of the data file would read: X  X   1    2	 2
</P>
<P>The "newton" command for intramolecular interactions must be "on" 
(which is the default).
</P>
<P>This angle style should not be used with SHAKE.
